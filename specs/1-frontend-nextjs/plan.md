# Implementation Plan: Next.js Frontend for Todo App

**Branch**: `1-frontend-nextjs` | **Date**: 2026-01-06 | **Spec**: [specs/1-frontend-nextjs/spec.md](specs/1-frontend-nextjs/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Development of a Next.js + Tailwind CSS frontend for the Todo application that replicates and enhances the functionality of the existing CLI version. The frontend will provide a web-based interface for task management with responsive design, filtering, and sorting capabilities.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript, Next.js 14+
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, axios/fetch for API calls
**Storage**: N/A (will connect to existing backend API)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop and mobile)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend only)
**Performance Goals**: Page load under 3 seconds, UI interactions under 100ms
**Constraints**: Must not modify existing backend/src code, responsive design for 320px-1920px screens
**Scale/Scope**: Single user application, no concurrent user requirements

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the constitution:
- Spec-Driven Development: All code must be generated based on written specs ✓
- No Manual Code by User: All code must be generated by CCR based on written specs ✓
- Phase Progression: Building Phase 2 (Full Stack Web App) on top of Phase 1 (CLI Todo) ✓
- Code Quality Priority: Focus on clear separation of concerns ✓
- Spec Compliance: Implementation based strictly on feature spec ✓

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) selected with dedicated frontend/ directory to house Next.js application that connects to existing backend without modifying it.
