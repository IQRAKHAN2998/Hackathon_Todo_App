# 5-phase Hackathon Todo System Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
All code must be generated based strictly on written specs; No feature may be implemented without an approved spec; Specs are the single source of truth

### No Manual Code by User
The user will NOT write any manual code; All code must be generated by CCR based on written specs

### Spec-Based Bug Fixes
If a bug or issue occurs, it MUST be fixed by updating the spec, not by directly patching code

### Phase Progression
Each phase must build on top of the previous phase without breaking it; The 5 phases are: Console Todo, Full Stack Web App, AI Todo Agent, Kubernetes Deployment, Event-Driven System

### Code Quality Priority
Code clarity, separation of concerns, and judge readability are higher priority than feature count

### Spec Compliance
If a behavior or feature is not defined in a spec, it must not be implemented

## Phase-Specific Requirements
Phase 1: Python-based CLI Todo app with in-memory data, no external libraries beyond Python standard library. Phase 2: Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend with JWT authentication. Phase 3: AI agent using MCP tools for Todo management. Phase 4: Containerized deployment with Helm charts. Phase 5: Event-driven architecture with Kafka or Dapr.

## Development Workflow
Follow Spec-Driven Development workflow using Spec-Kit; Implement features incrementally through the 5 phases.

## Governance
Constitution applies to all 5 phases; Global rules apply to all phases; Phase-specific rules apply within each phase; Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation.
